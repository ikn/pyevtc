pyevtc (prerelease).

Python 3 library for parsing and analysing arcdps combat logs (EVTC format).
Currently in a very early stage of development.

* generally works by reading the whole log into a SQLite database and then
  providing an interface to that, but also allows breaking up the process to
  gain access to the log at various stages
* uses iterators throughout, never reading large amounts of data into memory
  (unless you use an in-memory SQLite database)
